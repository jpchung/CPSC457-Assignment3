EVALUATION

-----------
Question 1:

For the first simulation of the coffee shop, both the train model and space models were initialized with 4 baristas, and were assigned to fill the orders of customers over a range of 5 to 500.
From that, the times to completion for each order was documented for both the train and space baristas, and the average of 3 simulation runs was graphed (see accompanying Excel spreadsheet).

From the results of the 3 simulation runs, we can observe that given equal number of baristas and relatively uniform customer orders, the order completion times of both models increase as the number of customers to serve increases. Not only that, but the performance of the train and space models are extremely close and with little variation between the average slopes of the two models. As such, we can conclude that in this scenario there is little significant difference in efficiency between running the barista train model as opposed to barista space model.

-----------
Question 2:

For the second simulation, the number of customers is kept constant at 100, but the number of baristas for the two models both start at 2, and both increase by the same number of baristas after a set time interval until they reach a maximum of 10. Once again, the average of 3 simulation runs of completion times for both models were graphed.
From the results of the 3 simulation runs, we can observe that for the completion time for the space model thread is longer than that for the train model given fewer baristas. Most notably, the recorded completion time for 2 baristas in the space model is approximately double that for 2 baristas in the train model, despite both having a constant 100 customer queue to serve. The train model also maintains a relatively consistent completion time in light of the constant 100 customers.
This result is not surprising, as for the train model both baristas are working towards finishing a single order, whereas the space model separates the customer transaction and order processing between the 2 baristas, meaning only one barista is actively filling a customer order.
However, as the number of baristas increases evenly over time, the difference in performance between the space and train models reduces, until they are once again nearly uniform. 
The reason that the space model increases in performance is due to more baristas resulting more baristas being delegated producing and clearing orders (while there is always at most one "cashier" barista in our implementation).
As such, there is evidence to suggest that given a uniformly large number of customers, the train model requires fewer baristas to optimize order throughput than the space model does, due to the differing structure of barista duties between the models.

-----------
Question 3:

For the third simulatiom, our main concern is measuring the rate of barista throughput against different customer generation rates. the default model in the simulation is the train model, which is initialized with 4 baristas, and an initial 5 customers. However, every 10 seconds the number of customers generated and awaiting their orders is increased, with the goal of findiing the rate at which customers coming in overtakes the ability of the 4 baristas to clear the orders, the breaking point at which baristas can never finish clearing all orders. 
For the implementation of the simulation, 40 was chosen as the maximum number of customers to check for, with an incrementation of 5 customers per 5 seconds from the starting 5. From our results, we can observe that prior to 30 customers, the 4 baristas are fully capable of clearing orders almost immediately. For 30-35 customers, we start to see a significant increase in time needed for the baristas to clear orders, with the critical rate seeming to be 35 customers/10 seconds. This is extrapolated by the exponential increase in clear times for the rates of 40 customers/10 seconds onward. As such, we can infer from the average of 3 simulations that 35 customers/10 seconds that 4 baristas can serve in reasonable time.
We also run the simulation again, keeping simulation conditions the same save that the initial number of baristas is now 5 instead of 4. As expected, the extra barista reduces the time for completion significantly, as the amount of concurrent operations is also increased by the extra barista's contributions.


-----------
Question 4:
For the final simulation, we can pose the question of how order clear time is affected if there are additional items on the menu with extreme production times. Specifically, what would happen to the performance of both models if there an item with a significantly longer production time, and another item with a very short production time?
By modifying the random production time generation of the simulation to give items a 1/5 chance of having a 2000ms production time, and a 1/5 chance of having a 10ms production time. Like in the first simulation, the number of baristas is same for both models, which each getting 4. The number of customers was set to be a range over 5 to 100.
From our results, we can observe an increased divergence in the performance of the space and train models when there are more customers to serve, with the space model requiring more time to clear orders than train model. This result again goes back to the workflow of the baristas in each model; since all baristas in the train model work towards filling single orders, the loss of throughput incurred by receiving an order with a 2000ms itme is mitigated, and the time benefits of 10ms items more easily highlighted. This explains the slight dips in time for train clearing despite an increase in customers, as opposed to the more consistently slowing space baristas.
